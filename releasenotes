This release continuosly monitors the temperatures using the BMP180 sensor
and sends the data to Ubitdots.
The time between two sensorreads and data pushes is determined by the ubidot slider.

There is also an Alarm setting in Ubidot. The program checks for alarm status
every 10 seconds, if the alarm is set the normal interval time is ignored and data is send every 10 seconds, until the alarm is switched off.
